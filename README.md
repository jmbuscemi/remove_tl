# Remove Turbolinks

Turbolinks can cause JS troubles in a rails app, unless properly used. This is a simple gem to remove everything related to turbolinks from a rails app.

## Use
1. `gem install remove_tl`
2. Add file remove_tl.rb to the root directory of your Rails app.
3. cd my_awesome_app
4. ruby remove_tl.rb
5. Enjoy a turbolinks free app, where your FE engineers won't be confused as to why none of their JS isn't working properly.

## Contribute to this gem
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the it.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch - `git checkout -b feature`.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
